# Photo-Editor
Photo Editor allows the user to upload any PNG file and adjust brightness, contrast, warmth, saturation, and apply a variety of photo filters such as Vignette, Black and White, Invert, Solarise, and Pixelize. 

I developed a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays the original and edited image side by side as the user applies his or her edits. I designed the filters by using mathematical algorithms to manipulate pixel data in the form of RGB and HSV values. I also implemented an edit history that tracks up to 50 modifications, allowing the user to undo and reset edits to an image. All code was written in Python. After the user is satisfied with the edited photo, he or she may save the photo directly to his or her device.
